The tests, executed using Selenium WebDriver with Python, ensure the application's functionality and accuracy.

## Scope
The test cases cover the following key areas of the Sauce Labs application:
- **User Authentication**
- **Product Catalog**
- **Shopping Cart**
- **Checkout Process**
- **Price Accuracy**

## Testing Environment
- **Framework**: Selenium WebDriver with Python
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Browsers Tested**: Chrome
